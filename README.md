# Stats.fm Booster

A simple Go program to generate mock Spotify streaming data for importing into StatsFM. Simulate streams for your favorite tracks.

---

## What Does This Do?

This program generates fake Spotify streaming data in JSON format, which you can import into StatsFM. It allows you to simulate streams for any track, album, or artist by providing a Spotify ID or link.

**Note**: StatsFM does not currently verify the legitimacy of imported data, but excessive use of this tool may result in a ban. Use responsibly!
